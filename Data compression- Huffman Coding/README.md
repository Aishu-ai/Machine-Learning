<p>Huffman coding is one of the fundamental compression algorithms used in image and video compression
standards. Huffman coding is based on assigning variable-length codes to symbols in such a way that
the most frequently occurring symbols have the shortest codes. The main idea behind Huffman coding
is to calculate the frequency of input characters, sort them based on decreasing frequency, and use this
information to construct a Huffman Tree that assigns binary codes to each character. This enables
efficient compression of data, including image data, by exploiting the statistical regularities present in
the input data.</p></br>

<p>This project focuses on using Huffman coding to compress images. It also mentions some of the areas of improvement it can have and how it fares when compared to other compression algorithms.</p>
