<h1>  Various plots obtained</h1>
<h3>pair_plot.png</h3>
<p>Pair plot for the abalone data. Includes scatter plots, box plots of each variable against another. Also includes covariance between all pairs of variables.</p>
<h3>aic_model_plots.png</h3>
<p>Contains the qq-plot and the residuals vs.fitted plot for the AIC model obtained after running AIC on the simple additive model.</p>
<h3>aic_vs_variables.png</h3>
<p>Plot of the AIC value of the model against the number of variables in each model.</p>
<h3>log_model_plot.png</h3>
<p>Contains the qq-plot and the residuals vs. fitted plot for the log-transformed additive model(with 8 predictor variables).</p>
<h3>coch_model_plot.png</h3>
<p>Contains the qq-plot and the residuals vs. fitted plot for the log-transformed additive model after addressing autocorrelation between errors</p>
