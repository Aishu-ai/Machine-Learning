# Predicting age of abalone using regression
# Introduction
  - Abalone is a shellfish considered a delicacy in many parts of the world. An excellent source of iron and pantothenic acid, and a nutritious food resource and farming in Australia, America and East Asia. 100 grams of abalone yields more than 20% recommended daily intake of these nutrients. The economic value of abalone is positively correlated with its age. Therefore, to detect the age of abalone accurately is important for both farmers and customers to determine its price. However, the current technology to decide the age is quite costly and inefficient. Farmers usually cut the shells and count the rings through microscopes to estimate the abalones age. Telling the age of abalone is therefore difficult mainly because their size depends not only on their age, but on the availability of food as well. Moreover, abalone sometimes form the so-called 'stunted' populations which have their growth characteristics very different from other abalone populations This complex method increases the cost and limits its popularity. Our goal in this report is to find out the best indicators to forecast the rings, then the age of abalones.
